# CNN-Model-For-Dental-Cavity-Detection

## Introduction:
Dental cavity detection is a hard task to accomplish because of the odd features of the teeth. In a dental radiograph, there are a lot of factors that affect the quality and readability of the image. These factor make it difficult for a dentist to read the issue in the x-ray properly. I have designed a system that would first enhance the quality of the image, to increase the readability of the image, and then it would also detect the cavity in the image if present.

## About Project:
Built a CNN Model that can detect a Cavity in a Dental X-ray

Steps:
1. First collect an image dataset.
2. Create annotations on the object you want to detect in image using labelimg in .csv format.
3. Provide path of dataset and .csv file in the required fields.
4. Train your model.
5. Test the results.
